The immediate goal is to be able to take the default
coordinate data from Perl's Astro::Montenbruck's 
'script/simple_ephem.pl' and use coordinate and number format data to
duplicate the data produced for the 'script/planpos.pl'
file run for a location at Greenwich.

Need to port CoCo.pm, MathUtils.pm, and Time.pm to Raku, with tests.
